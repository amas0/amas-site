summary: "Games would be rather uninteresting if all we did was roll single
dice. In this post, we dive into calculating the probabilities associated
with the sum of many dice rolls."

Rolling a whole handful of dice, other than being an extraordinarily fun 
thing to do, is a simple way to generate a random number from a complex 
distribution. In <Link to="/posts/dice-roll-probability">previous</Link>
<Link to="/posts/dice-roll-expectations">posts</Link>, we explored the
comparatively simple cases of rolling one and two dice. We made the general
observation that as you roll many dice, the total value has a probability
distribution that tends to concentrate near the expected value. In this post,
we are going to take a closer look at that process and compute the probability 
distribution for the sum of many dice rolls.
