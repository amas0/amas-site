Rolling a whole handful of dice, other than being an extraordinarily fun 
thing to do, is a simple way to generate a random number from a not-so-simple 
distribution. In <Link to="/posts/dice-roll-probability">previous</Link> <Link to="/posts/dice-roll-expectations">posts</Link>, we explored the
 cases of rolling just one or two dice. We made the general
observation that as you roll many dice, the total value has a probability
distribution that tends to concentrate near the expected value. In this post,
we are going to take a closer look at that process and compute the probability 
distribution for the sum of many dice rolls.

Fair warning - this post is going to get pretty math heavy![^1]

## Counting possible dice roll outcomes

When being first introduced to probability, people often work problems 
involving dice, coins, or games -- really any sort of game of chance. These 
problems are typically solved not by appealing to any particular probability 
distribution, but by _counting outcomes_. For example, consider the following
problem. 

> **What is the probability of rolling a total of 3 on a 2d6 roll?**

> There are 36 total possible outcomes, 6 for each dice and since they are 
> independent, we take the product for the total number of outcomes. Now we

The above is not too hard, but it's easy to imagine how much of a pain
this could be if you're trying to sum up say 10 20-sided dice. Oof. 

Without telling you why just yet, let's take a look at this polynomial:

$$
f(x) = x + x^2 + x^3 + x^4 + x^5 + x^6
$$

Just the [all ones polynomial](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/All_one_polynomial)
without the constant 1. Let's take the square of this polynomial and expand it:

$$
\begin{aligned}
f(x)^2 = x^2 &+ 2 x^3 + 3x^4 + 4x^5 +5x^6 + 6x^7 \\
&+ 5x^8 + 4x^9 + 3x^{10} + 2x^{11} + x^{12}
\end{aligned}
$$

If you look _carefully_ at the coefficients, you may notice that they correspond
exactly to the number of ways to get a given sum on a 2d6 roll. There's one way 
to get a 2, two ways to get a 3 (that's the one we did above), three ways to
get a 4, and so on and so forth. If we want to get the probability of rolling 
a particular outcome from 2d6, we pick the value, say 3 like above, and look 
at the coefficient of $x^3$. We take that coefficient and divide by 36 to get 
the probability - $\frac{2}{36}$ just like above.

The important thing we've shown here is an alternate way to count the 
outcomes -- and therefore compute the probability -- of a sum of dice rolls.
Instead of directly counting, we can find polynomial coefficients.
The above we only show for 6 sided dice, the general form of the polynomial 
for a sum of $m$ $n$-sided dice is given by:

$$
g(x) = \frac{1}{n^m}\left(\sum_{i=1}^n x^i\right)^m
$$ 

We divide the whole polynomial by the total number of outcomes to make
the coefficients probabilities instead of counts. To explicitly state this
full problem using random variables, we write:

$$
X_i \sim \textrm{Dice}(n) \qquad Y = \sum_{i=1}^m X_i
$$

Then, **finding $P(Y=y)$ can be done by finding the coefficient of 
$x^y$ in the polynomial $g(x)$ above.**

_For the astute of you, this is a conceptual approach to solving
this problem with [probability generating functions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Probability-generating_function). We could have gone straight there, but
I find the counting line of reasoning to be a satisfying way to see why this
works._

## Tricky polynomials and series

Just knowing that we _can_ compute probabilities using polynomial 
coefficients doesn't mean that it's easy. In this case, it is possible, 
but we are going to have to do some polynomial manipulation to get where
we want to go.
