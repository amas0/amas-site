Rolling a whole handful of dice, other than being an extraordinarily fun 
thing to do, is a simple way to generate a random number from a not-so-simple 
distribution. In <Link to="/posts/dice-roll-probability">previous</Link> <Link to="/posts/dice-roll-expectations">posts</Link>, we explored the
 cases of rolling just one or two dice. We made the general
observation that as you roll many dice, the total value has a probability
distribution that tends to concentrate near the expected value. In this post,
we are going to take a closer look at that process and compute the probability 
distribution for the sum of many dice rolls.

Fair warning - this post is going to get pretty math heavy![^1]

## Counting possible dice roll outcomes

When being first introduced to probability, people often work problems 
involving dice, coins, or games -- really any sort of game of chance. These 
problems are typically solved not by appealing to any particular probability 
distribution, but by _counting outcomes_. For example, consider the following
problem.

The above is not too hard, but it's easy to imagine how much of a pain
this could be if you're trying to sum up say 10 20-sided dice. Oof. 

Without telling you why just yet, let's take a look at this polynomial:

$$
f(x) = x + x^2 + x^3 + x^4 + x^5 + x^6
$$

Just the [all ones polynomial](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/All_one_polynomial)
without the constant 1. Let's take the square of this polynomial and expand it:

$$
\begin{aligned}
f(x)^2 = x^2 &+ 2 x^3 + 3x^4 + 4x^5 +5x^6 + 6x^7 \\
&+ 5x^8 + 4x^9 + 3x^{10} + 2x^{11} + x^{12}
\end{aligned}
$$

If you look _carefully_ at the coefficients, you may notice that they correspond
exactly to the number of ways to get a given sum on a 2d6 roll. There's one way 
to get a 2, two ways to get a 3 (that's the one we did above), three ways to
get a 4, and so on and so forth. If we want to get the probability of rolling 
a particular outcome from 2d6, we pick the value, say 3 like above, and look 
at the coefficient of $x^3$. We take that coefficient and divide by 36 to get 
the probability - $\frac{2}{36}$ just like above.

The important thing we've shown here is an alternate way to count the 
outcomes -- and therefore compute the probability -- of a sum of dice rolls.
Instead of directly counting, we can find polynomial coefficients.
The above we only show for 6 sided dice, the general form of the polynomial 
for a sum of $m$ $n$-sided dice is given by:

$$
g(x) = \frac{1}{n^m}\left(\sum_{i=1}^n x^i\right)^m
$$ 

We divide the whole polynomial by the total number of outcomes to make
the coefficients probabilities instead of counts. To explicitly state this
full problem using random variables, we write:

$$
X_i \sim \textrm{Dice}(n) \qquad Y = \sum_{i=1}^m X_i
$$

Then, **finding $P(Y=y)$ can be done by finding the coefficient of 
$x^y$ in the polynomial $g(x)$ above.**

_For the astute of you, this is a conceptual approach to solving
this problem with [probability generating functions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Probability-generating_function). We could have gone straight there, but
I find the counting line of reasoning to be a satisfying way to see why this
works._

## Tricky polynomials and series

Just knowing that we _can_ compute probabilities using polynomial 
coefficients doesn't mean that it's easy. In this case, it is possible, 
but we are going to have to do some polynomial manipulation to get where
we want to go.

First, we'll start with the following way to rewrite our original polynomial
$f(x)$:

$$
\sum_{i=1}^n x^i = \frac{x(x^n-1)}{x-1}
$$

This can be directly verified by polynomial division. From this we can rewrite 
$g(x)$ as:

$$
g(x) = \frac{1}{n^m} \frac{x^m(x^n-1)^m}{(x-1)^m}
$$

We will start by taking a look at the term $(x^n - 1)^m$. We can expand 
this back into a sum with the [binomial theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binomial_theorem):

$$
(x^n - 1)^m = \sum_{j=0}^m {m \choose j} x^{nj} (-1)^{m-j}
$$

Multiplying through by $x^m$ we get:

$$
x^m(x^n - 1)^m = \sum_{j=0}^m {m \choose j} x^{nj + m} (-1)^{m-j}
$$

So let's keep in mind this bit, which represents the numerator of $g(x)$
and turn our attention to the denominator, $(x-1)^{-m}$. Again we can 
rewrite this as a sum, but this time as a [binomial series](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binomial_series), which 
generalizes the binomial theorem to complex exponents:

$$
(x-1)^{-m} = (-1)^{-m}(1-x)^{-m} = (-1)^{-m}\sum_{k=0}^\infty {k + m - 1 \choose m - 1} x^k
$$

We can now write $g(x)$ in it's full glory as the product of the sum and 
series:

$$
g(x) = \frac{1}{n^m} \left(\sum_{j=0}^m {m \choose j} x^{nj + m} (-1)^{m-j}
\right) \left((-1)^{-m}\sum_{k=0}^\infty {k + m - 1 \choose m - 1} x^k
\right)
$$

We can make a slight simplification by bringing the factor of $(-1)^{-m}$
into the first sum to give (we can also rewrite $(-1)^{-j} = (-1)^j$):

$$
g(x) = \frac{1}{n^m} \left(\sum_{j=0}^m (-1)^{j}{m \choose j} x^{nj + m} 
\right) \left(\sum_{k=0}^\infty {k + m - 1 \choose m - 1} x^k
\right)
$$

We can think of the first discrete sum as an infinite sum where we are 
summing up $0$s when $j > m$. With this in mind, we can take the 
[Cauchy product](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cauchy_product) of the 
two series to get the coefficients, which generally states:

$$
\left(\sum_{i=0}^\infty a_i x^i\right)
\left(\sum_{j=0}^\infty b_j x^j\right) = 
\sum_{k=0}^\infty c_k x^k
$$

Where the coefficients $c_k$ are given by:

$$
c_k = \sum_{l=0}^k a_k b_{k-l}
$$

Those coefficients are the key. This whole business we're going through 
is to get those coefficients. Remember -- those coefficients will be 
our probabilities. Now, in our series above we have to do careful 
accounting about which of the coefficients are zero when doing the 
product. When all is said and done, we are left with the following
expression:

$$
g(x) = \frac{1}{n^m}\sum_{k=0}^\infty \left(\sum_{l=0}^{\left\lfloor\frac{k - m}{n}\right\rfloor} (-1)^l {m \choose l} {k - nl - 1 \choose m - 1}
\right)x^k
$$

Where $\lfloor a \rfloor$ is the floor function that rounds down to the 
nearest integer. 

## The probability distribution

When all is said and done, we can ignore the full power
series and only look at the coefficients to write our final expression 
for the probability mass function:

$$
\boxed{
P(Y=y) = \frac{1}{n^m}\sum_{l=0}^{\left\lfloor\frac{y - m}{n}\right\rfloor} (-1)^l {m \choose l} {y - nl - 1 \choose m - 1}
}
$$

Needless to say, it's not the cleanest of expressions. You'd have to 
pay me quite a bit to calculate any probabilities by hand from this.
It is correct though! Exactly so.

It's pretty tough to divine what this distribution looks like 
just from the closed form, we'll get a better idea if we look at a 
graph of the distribution. Below we show the shapes of the distribution
for 2, 3, and 4 d6 rolls. 

<VegaWrapper spec={sums_d6} />

The triangular distribution the characterizes the 2d6 rolls smooths
out as we increase the number of dice and approaches the more 
familiar bell curve.
