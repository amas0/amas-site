summary: "Rolling for stats in DnD 5e always carries the risk of creating a weak 
character. Many tables offer a player the chance to reroll if bad luck strikes. We 
show that offering the possibility of a reroll inflates a character's expected stats."

Rolling for stats in DnD 5e always carries the risk of ending up with
a weak character. Despite recommendations to use the standard array,
point buy, or any number of homebrew rules for generating stats, rolling
rules-as-written nevertheless remains common. For these tables, poor rolls
inevitably occur, and when that happens, many DMs implement _bad luck
protection_ by allowing bad stats to be rerolled.

In this post, we look at the mathematical consequences of rerolling your stat
array. By setting a limit on how bad a player can roll before allowing a
reroll -- we call that limit the _bad luck threshold_ -- the underlying
distribution of possible outcomes changes and biases ability scores higher
than they would otherwise be.

## Reviewing the standard array and rolling RAW

Before we dive into how rerolling changes the odds, let's review how rolling 
rules-as-written compares to the standard array. As a reminder, the standard
array is [8, 10, 12, 13, 14, 15]. Rolling for stats with 4d6 dropping the
lowest generates a wide range of possible outcomes.

The chart below compares the two methods. The top-left shows the distribution
of possible outcomes for the _lowest_ value in your rolled array; typical
values are somewhere between 6 and 11. The red line at 8 indicates the
corresponding standard array values. Moving right, we see the distribution 
for the next highest stat in the array. This continues until the bottom-right,
showing the possible outcomes of the highest stat in the array.

The standard array more or less selects the average from rolling, but not 
always! Interestingly, the largest deviation is the highest stat -- rolling
more often than not gives 16 or higher, compared to the standard array's 15.

Seemingly small differences result in the fact that rolling will _on average_
give higher ability scores than the standard array. By looking at the _total
ability score_ of the array, which is sum of the whole array, we get a
better idea of how they compare. The figure below shows the bell-shaped 
curved of the total ability scores from rolling compared to the red line of 
the standard array.

<VegaWrapper spec={total_stat_rolling_vs_standard_vega} />

The standard array's red line is slightly left-of-center of the
potential outcomes from rolling. Compared to the standard array's 72 total 
ability score, rolling has an expected value of about 73.5. An extra point or
two isn't earth-shattering, but it is a difference worth noting.

## Bad luck protection and the upward bias of rolled stats

Armed with an understanding of how different rules generate differing ability
scores for a character (point buy is beyond this post's scope), we shift our 
focus to how these rules work _in practice_.

As mentioned in the intro, many groups rightly prioritize the enjoyment of
the players over some arbitrary standard of mathematical fairness by
rerolling bad arrays. This biases the total ability score upwards by cutting
out extreme lows.

One can imagine that a player who has the misfortune to roll significantly
under the standard array may want a reroll. This has the effect of chopping
off the left side of the total ability score distribution and increasing the
odds of the remaining outcomes.

The chart below shows how that shift happens -- the underlying yellow-orange
bars represent the full possible outcomes of rolling, whereas the slightly
higher overlaid blue bars show how the distribution changes when it gets cuts
off. The bad luck threshold shown here is the point where we say "any stats 
that are worse than this should be rerolled".

<VegaWrapper spec={total_stat_threshold_vega} />

The relatively modest bad luck threshold shown above, where a player rerolls
when their total ability score is 60 or below (which are effectively commoner
stats!), has the same shape as before, but with the left tail cut off.
Although the difference seems minor, it is enough to raise the expected total
ability score from 73.5 to 74. **By allowing players to reroll commoner-tier
stats, they expect to gain half of an ability score in the process.**

Every bad luck threshold we pick gives a different expected boost to your
ability score. 

The figure below shows just how that bonus varies. The horizontal axis
represents the different thresholds we can set. Higher bad luck thresholds
correspond to being more generous with rerolls. The vertical axis is our
expected total ability score when we roll using this bad luck protection
rule.

As we increase the threshold, we see our expected stat total increase (as 
represented by the blue markers). Our previous threshold of 60 puts us right 
at a full ability score increase above the standard array. Increasing it to 
a higher value of 68 or so is equivalent to two full ASIs above the standard 
array.

<VegaWrapper spec={excess_stat_bad_luck_vega} />

When phrased in terms of ASIs, it's clear that rolling RAW already gives a
notable average boost over the standard array. Adding even a small amount of
bad luck protection to that pushes the disparity even further.

As mentioned previously, a bad luck threshold of 60 -- which corresponds 
to an average ability score of 10 -- is enough to push rolling to a full 
ASI above the standard array. A more generous threshold of 66, or an 
average ability score of 11, doubles the expected stat bonus of rolling 
from 1.5 to 3 above the standard array.

Of course, a single number like the total ability score cannot capture 
all of the nuances that come into play when determining what is a "good"
stat array. Having a very strong primary stat can more than make up for 
a poor dump stat or two, and none of that nuance is appropriately 
captured by this post. Regardless, **when looking at different methods 
for generating ability scores, it's important to explore how they are 
used _in practice_ for an honest comparison between them.**

## Some thoughts on fairness 

There is nothing wrong with ensuring everyone is happy by allowing players to
rerolls stats, but tables should be wary as to how this method can affect
players that use different stat generating methods. **If some players want to
roll and others prefer to use the standard array, bad luck protection can
lead to a lopsided power balance in favor of the rollers.**

On one hand, it is something that could easily go by unnoticed and (in all
honesty) likely wouldn't have too much of an effect on the game. On the other
hand, it could feel bad to effectively give an ASI to some players at
character creation and not to others. Encouraging everyone to use the same
method for generating ability scores ensures an even playing field, but if a
table does split, buffing the standard array by an ASI isn't a half-bad way
to go.

Another point that often comes up in these discussions about rolling for stats 
is the opposite problem -- good luck protection. Players who roll far above 
their party members may feel guilty about their greater character power and 
choose to reroll to get a more average array. This has a counteracting
effect, pushing the expected ability scores lower. One strategy to constrain
extreme ability scores is to reroll on _both_ overly weak and overly 
strong characters. If the reroll rules are symmetric, it leaves the expected 
stats unchanged from the original method. 

The goal of character creation should always be to create a party of
adventurers that your table is excited to play. Keeping in mind that something 
as simple as allowing a player to reroll their stats will inflate them is
worth keeping in mind, so that you can ensure balanced table where everyone
can shine.
