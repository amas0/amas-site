summary: "Rolling for stats in DnD 5e always carries the risk of creating a weak 
character. Many tables offer a player the chance to reroll if bad luck strikes. We 
show that offering the possibility of a reroll inflates a character's expected stats."

Rolling for stats in DnD 5e always carries the risk of ending up with
a weak character. Despite recommendations to use the standard array,
point buy, or any number of homebrew rules for generating stats, rolling
rules-as-written nevertheless remains. For these tables, bad luck will
inevitably strike, and when that happens, many DMs allow rerolling a bad
array so that everyone is happy.

In this post, we look at the mathematical consequences of rerolling your stat
array. We will explore the fact that allowing for stat arrays to be rerolled
fundamentally changes the underlying distribution of possible outcomes and
biases ability scores higher than they would otherwise be.

## Reviewing the standard array and rolling RAW

Before we dive into how rerolling changes the odds, let's review how rolling 
rules-as-written compares to the standard array. As a reminder, the standard
array is [8, 10, 12, 13, 14, 15]. Rolling for stats with 4d6 dropping the
lowest generates a distribution of possible outcomes.

The below charts compare the range of likely outcomes from rolling to the
standard array for each value from lowest to highest.

The standard array more or less selects the average from rolling, but not 
always! Interestingly, the largest deviation is in the highest stat -- the
standard array gives a 15, whereas rolling more often than not results in a
16 or higher.

Seemingly small differences result in the fact that rolling will _on average_
give higher ability scores than the standard array. By looking at the _total
ability score_ of the array, which is all stats added together, we get a
better idea of how they compare.

<VegaWrapper spec={total_stat_rolling_vs_standard_vega} />

The standard array gives a total ability score of 72, whereas the expected 
value from rolling is about 73.5 -- an extra point or two isn't
earth-shattering, but it is a difference worth noting.

## Bad luck protection and the upward bias of rolled stats

Armed with an understanding of how different rules generate differing ability
scores for a character (point buy is beyond this post's scope), we shift our 
focus to how these rules work _in practice_.

As mentioned in the intro, many groups rightly prioritize the enjoyment of
the players over some arbitrary standard of mathematical fairness by
rerolling bad arrays. This biases the total ability score upwards by cutting
out extreme lows.

One can imagine that a player who has the misfortune to roll significantly
under the standard array may want a reroll. This has the effect of chopping
off the left side of the total ability score distribution and increasing the
odds of the remaining outcomes.

<VegaWrapper spec={total_stat_threshold_vega} />

The relatively modest cutoff shown above, where a player rerolls when their total 
ability score is 60 or below (which are effectively commoner stats!), has the
same shape as before, but with the left tail cut off. Although the difference
seems minor, it is enough to raise the expected total ability score from 73.5
to 74. **By allowing players to reroll commoner-tier stats, they expect to
gain half of an ability score in the process.**

Every "bad luck threshold" below which stats are allowed to be rerolled
gives a different expected boost to your ability score. The figure below shows 
just how that bonus varies.

<VegaWrapper spec={excess_stat_bad_luck_vega} />

Even a small amount of bad luck protection increases expected stats a full
ability score increase above the standard array. More generous reroll
policies pushes the expected ability score total even higher. 

## Some thoughts on fairness 

There is nothing wrong with ensuring everyone is happy by allowing players to
rerolls stats, but tables should be wary as to how this method can affect
players that use different stat generating methods. **If some players want to
roll and others prefer to use the standard array, bad luck protection can
lead to a lopsided power balance in favor of the rollers.**

On one hand, it is something that could easily go by unnoticed and (in all
honesty) likely wouldn't have too much of an effect on the game. On the other
hand, it could feel bad to effectively give an ASI to some players at
character creation and not to others. Encouraging everyone to use the same
method for generating ability scores ensures an even playing field, but if a
table does split, buffing the standard array by an ASI isn't a half-bad way
to go.

Another point that often comes up in these discussions about rolling for stats 
is the opposite problem -- good luck protection. Players who roll far above 
their party members may feel guilty about their greater character power and 
choose to reroll to get a more average array. This has a counteracting
effect, pushing the expected ability scores lower. One strategy to constrain
extreme ability scores is to reroll on _both_ overly weak and overly 
strong characters. If the reroll rules are symmetric, it leaves the expected 
stats unchanged from the original method. 

The goal of character creation should always be to create a party of
adventurers that your table is excited to play. Keeping in mind that something 
as simple as allowing a player to reroll their stats will inflate them is
worth keeping in mind, so that you can ensure balanced table where everyone
can shine.
