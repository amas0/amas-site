In Dungeons and Dragons 5th edition, the [Advantage and
Disadvantage](https://5thsrd.org/rules/advantage_and_disadvantage/) mechanic
provides a straightforward and powerful way to tip the scales of fate in
favor
(or against) the characters depending on the circumstances they face. The 
mechanic works like this -- when rolling a d20 (20-sided dice) to determine
the outcome of some action, you instead roll two d20s and keep either the
higher result (with advantage) or the lower (with disadvantage). This process
changes the odds of a particular outcome, and, to explore exactly how that
happens, we will derive the probability distributions of rolling with
advantage and disadvantage.

## Two dice rolls and the comparisons between them

Every dice roll serves as a means to sample from an underlying probability 
distribution. <Link to="/posts/dice-roll-probability">As discussed in a
previous post</Link>, this underlying distribution is one that picks a 
random number between 1 and $n$, the number of sides on the dice, which
we can call the _dice roll distribution_. 

Rolling two dice does nothing more than generate a sample of size two 
instead of one from underlying distribution. As with most dice rolls,
we assume that the outcome on one dice has no effect on the other, or
[independence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independence_(probability_theory)).

We write the following to represent our random sample:

$$
X_1, X_2 \sim \textrm{Dice}(n)
$$

Simply meaning that $X_1$ and $X_2$ both represent the random outcome of an
$n$-sided dice roll. Although the advantage/disadvantage mechanic applies to
$n=20$, it's straightforward to explore the result for a general value $n$ and
substitute in 20 later.

Using our above notation, expressing advantage and disadvantage mathematically
just requires us to take minimum and maximum value of the random variables above:

$$
Y_{adv} = \max(X_1, X_2) \qquad Y_{dis} = \min(X_1, X_2)
$$

There's nothing particularly profound here. We've just defined explicitly
what advantage and disadvantage are.

## A little bit of algebra to get us going

What we are _actually_ interested is the probability that a roll with advantage
or disadvantage gives a specific value, e.g. $P(Y_{adv} = y)$. First, let's just 
focus on advantage. We can start by writing the following:

$$
P(Y_{adv} = y) = P(\max(X_1, X_2) = y)
$$

The probability that the maximum of two random variables is equal to $y$ can be 
rewritten as the probability that _one_ of the two variables is equal to $y$ and 
the other is less than $y$. Since either $X_1$ or $X_2$ can be the maximum, we 
just add together the same situation but swapped. There is one edge case this 
doesn't capture -- if $X_1 = X_2 = y$ -- we can add that on to get the full,
correct expression:

$$
\begin{aligned}
P(\max(X_1, X_2) = y) = P(X_1 = y, X_2 < y) &+ P(X_1 < y, X_2 = y)\\
&+ P(X_1 = y, X_2 = y)
\end{aligned}
$$

As $X_1$ and $X_2$ are independent, the joint probabilities become products, and 
beyond that, since $X_1$ and $X_2$ come from the same distribution, we can drop the 
subscript and just call them $X$ to refer to underlying dice roll distribution.


$$
\begin{aligned}
P(\max(X_1, X_2) = y) = P(X = y) P(X < y) &+ P(X < y)P(X = y) \\
&+ P(X=y)^2
\end{aligned}
$$

So the first two terms on the right side are identical, we can combine them to get:

$$
P(\max(X_1, X_2) = y) = 2 P(X = y) P(X < y) + P(X=y)^2
$$

One minor simplification, since $y$ is discrete, we can write $P(X < y) = P(X
\leq y-1)$. This gives (and also using the $Y_{adv}$ notation again)

$$
P(Y_{adv} = y) = 2 P(X = y) P(X \leq y-1) + P(X=y)^2
$$

So this gives us the probability mass function of rolling with advantage in
terms of the PMF and CDF of the dice roll distribution, $X$. Before we
substitute in those functions, let's quickly go through a similar process for
the disadvantage distribution:

$$
\begin{aligned}
P(Y_{dis} = y) &= P(\min(X_1, X_2) = y) \\
&= P(X_1 = y, X_2 > y) + P(X_1 > y, X_2 = y) + P(X_1=y, X_2 = y) \\
\end{aligned}
$$

Which gives, in similar form to above:

$$
P(Y_{dis} = y) = 2 P(X=y)P(X > y) + P(X = y)^2
$$

## The probability mass functions

To take our expressions to their final state, we just need to substitute in 
the functional forms of these probability statements <Link
to="/posts/dice-roll-probability">that we found previously</Link>. First,
let's take a look at advantage:

$$
P(Y_{adv} = y) = 2\left(\frac{1}{n}\right)\left(\frac{y-1}{n}\right) + \left(\frac{1}{n}\right)^2
$$

Which simplifies to:

$$
\boxed{ P(Y_{adv} = y) = \frac{2y - 1}{n^2} \qquad y\in\{1,\cdots,n\}}
$$

For disadvantage:

$$
P(Y_{dis} = y) = 2\left(\frac{1}{n}\right)\left(1 - \frac{y}{n}\right) + \left(\frac{1}{n}\right)^2
$$

Which simplifies to:

$$
\boxed{ P(Y_{dis} = y) = \frac{2(n - y + 1) - 1}{n^2} \qquad y\in\{1,\cdots,n\}}
$$

The above form shows the clear symmetries between the two processes. A great
way to really understand what these probability distributions look like is to
plot them. Below we show the probabilities of a d20 roll with advantage and
disadvantage.

<VegaWrapper spec={adv_vs_dis} />

A few things are immediately obvious -- advantage shifts the odds in favor of
high numbers, disadvantage does the same for low numbers, and they are mirror
images of each other. The symmetry of the probabilities is not terribly
surprising given the underlying process is symmetric, but it's nice to see
clearly. 

Another point worth making is the single most likely outcome for rolling with 
advantage is the max value of the dice. For disadvantage it's going to be
rolling a 1. While still unlikely in general, it's notable that you would 
expect to see the extreme outcomes more often than any other single value.

## The cumulative distribution functions 

We can take our work one step further and calculate the cumulative distribution
functions of advantage/disadvantage. Our approach will be to directly calculate:

$$
P(Y_{adv} \leq y) = \sum_{k=1}^y P(Y_{adv} = k) \qquad 
P(Y_{dis} \leq y) = \sum_{k=1}^y P(Y_{dis} = k)
$$

We'll start with advantage.

$$
\begin{aligned}
P(Y_{adv} \leq y) &= \sum_{k=1}^y  \frac{2k - 1}{n^2}\\
&= \frac{2}{n^2}\left(\sum_{k=1}^y k\right) - \frac{1}{n^2} \left(\sum_{k=1}^y 1 \right)
\end{aligned}
$$

Using the fact that $\sum_{k=1}^y k = y(y+1)/2$, the above expression
simplifies to:

$$
\boxed{
	P(Y_{adv} \leq y) = \left(\frac{y}{n}\right)^2 \qquad y\in\{1,\cdots,n\}
}
$$

We will carry out a nearly identical process for disadvantage:

$$
\begin{aligned}
P(Y_{dis} \leq y) &= \sum_{k=1}^y \frac{2(n - k + 1) - 1}{n^2}\\
&= \frac{2}{n}\left(\sum_{k=1}^y 1\right) - 
\frac{2}{n^2} \left(\sum_{k=1}^y k\right) + \frac{1}{n^2} \left(\sum_{k=1}^y 1\right)
\end{aligned}
$$

Similar to before we can evaluate these sums and get our final expression:

$$
\boxed{
	P(Y_{dis} \leq y) = \frac{2y}{n} - \left(\frac{y}{n}\right)^2 \qquad y\in\{1,\cdots,n\}

}
$$
