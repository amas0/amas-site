Often when rolling a dice, we know what we _want_ -- a high roll to defeat
the monster or the right number to win a wager -- unfortunately for us,
desire has little impact on the outcome of the roll. In these situations,
it's useful to know what to expect and how variable the outcome will be
around that expectation.

In this post, we define expectation and variance mathematically, compute 
them for dice rolls, and explore some key properties that help us 
understand the outcomes of rolls.

## Some definitions

By their names, we develop a decent intuition of what expectation and 
variance are trying to tell us. **Expectation (or expected value) gives us a
single value that summarizes the _average_ outcome**, often representing some
measure of the center of a probability distribution. **Variance quantifies how
variable the outcomes are _about the average_.** A low variance implies that
most of the outcomes are clustered near the expected value whereas a high 
variance implies the outcomes spread out far from the expected value.

Mathematically, we represent the expectation of a discrete random variable
$X$ as $E(X)$ and variance as $\mathrm{Var}(X)$. They are defined as follows:

$$
E(X) = \sum_{k=1}^n k P(X=k) \qquad \mathrm{Var}(X) = E(X^2) - E(X)^2
$$

Expectation is a weighted sum of outcomes by their probability and variance 
is itself defined in terms of expectations. As we primarily care about the 
outcomes of dice rolls, the sum only goes over the $n$ finite outcomes (it
can be defined generally as summing over infinite outcomes). 

One important thing to note about variance is that it depends on the squared
expectation _and_ the expectation of $X^2$. While we could calculate the
probability distribution of $X^2$ and use our above expression for
expectation, it is much easier to keep the following result in mind (called
the [law of the unconscious
statistician](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_of_the_unconscious_statistician)):

$$
E(g(X)) = \sum_{k=1}^n g(k) P(X=k)
$$

Which tells us that the expectation of a function, $g(X)$, can be computed 
using the original probability distribution and applying the function, $g$,
to the value of the outcomes in the sum.
