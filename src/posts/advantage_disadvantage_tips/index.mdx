In our <Link to="/posts/advantage-disadvantage-distribution">
previous post</Link>, we dug into the mathematics of DnD 5e's advantage and
disadvantage mechanic. Looking at the probability expressions we derived
allowed us to understand their general behavior. Here we go through
a few helpful rules of thumb to provide more practical results to
apply directly in your games.

## A few tips

As advantage and disadvantage only applies to d20 rolls in DnD, these results
come from our probability expressions with $n=20$.

#### Advantage

* The single _most likely_ outcome is a natural 20, occurring in about 1-in-10 rolls.
* The _least likely_ outcome is a natural 1, occurring in 1-in-400 rolls.
* There is about a _1-in-2_ chance of rolling a 15 or higher.
* There is about a _9-in-10_ chance of rolling a 7 or higher.
* Rolling a natural 20 is more likely than rolling _below_ a 7.

#### Disadvantage

* The single _most likely_ outcome is a natural 1, occurring in about 1-in-10 rolls.
* The _least likely_ outcome is a natural 20, occurring in 1-in-400 rolls.
* There is about a _1-in-2_ chance of rolling a 6 or lower.
* There is about a _9-in-10_ chance of rolling a 14 or lower.
* Rolling a natural 1 is more likely than rolling _above_ a 14.

## Why are these true statements?

A fairly straightforward way to show that all of the above statements are true 
is to examine the PMF and CDF graphs that we made for d20 rolls at the end 
of the last post. We show them again below:

<VegaWrapper spec={adv_vs_dis} />

<VegaWrapper spec={cdf} />

By mousing over or tapping on the graphs you can see the exact
probabilities of different situations. Mousing over the first graph
shows that the probability of a natural 20 with advantage is 0.0975, which is
about 1-in-10 and is _higher_ than the probability of rolling a 6 or lower 
with advantage as seen in the second graph (which is only 0.09).
By playing around with these, you can come up with all sorts of useful results!

Here's a concrete DnD 5e example -- a Champion Fighter scores a critical hit
when rolling a 19 or higher from its [Improved
Critical](https://roll20.net/compendium/dnd5e/Fighter#toc_19) feature. Looking 
at the graph above, we see that our fighter with advantage will crit on
average in 1 out of 5 hits! With an extra attack and Action Surge at their
disposal, an advantaged fighter is force to reckoned with.
