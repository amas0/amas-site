Exploding dice is a mechanic in various tabletop RPGs whereby a dice that
lands on its maximum values "explodes" -- meaning that the player then rolls
again, adding the new dice roll to the max value. If the exploded dice again
lands on its maximum, the dice explodes a second time. This process continues
and can lead to long chains of explosions that push the roll total far beyond
what would be normally expected.

This mechanic appears in a number of tabletop games, with 
[Savage Worlds](https://peginc.com/savage-settings/savage-worlds/) likely being
the most popular system within the RPG space that uses it. In this post, we 
dig into the infinite nature of exploding dice and explore the math and
expected outcomes from this fun mechanic.
