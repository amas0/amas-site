Exploding dice is a mechanic that appears in various tabletop games. It
works like this: a dice is rolled, if it lands on its maximum values, it
"explodes" -- the dice is then rolled again, adding the new value to
the max value of the dice. If dice again lands on its maximum, the dice
explodes a second time. This process continues and may lead to chains of
explosions that push the roll total far beyond what is normally expected.

This mechanic appears in a number of tabletop games, with 
[Savage Worlds](https://peginc.com/savage-settings/savage-worlds/) likely being
the most popular system within the RPG space that uses it. In this post, we 
dig into the infinite nature of exploding dice and explore the math and
expected outcomes from this fun mechanic.

## Exploding probabilities

Suppose we roll an $n$ sided exploding dice. The probability of rolling a
non-exploded value, that is between $1$ and $n-1$ is no different than a normal
dice roll. Each face below $n$ appears with equal probability $1/n$. If instead
the dice explodes -- which happens with the remaining probability $1/n$ -- we
add $n$ to the outcome of a new exploding dice roll.

Let's look at an example when we are rolling a 6-sided dice, so $n = 6$.
Any result between 1 and 5 appears with probability $1/6$. How about the
probability of rolling a 7?  Rolling a 7 requires rolling a 6 on the first roll,
triggering the explosion, and then rolling a 1 on the second:

$$
P(X = 7) = P(X = 6)P(X=1) = \frac{1}{6^2}
$$

Any value of the exploded dice roll can be written like this -- as powers of
$1/n$. Suppose we want to know the probability of rolling a 25 on an exploding
d6. Well that's just rolling 6 four times in a row followed by a 1, so $p = 1/6^5$.
In general, for an $n$ sided dice, the probability of rolling any given value is:


$$
\boxed{
P(X = x) = \begin{cases}
\left(\frac{1}{n}\right)^{\lfloor{x/n}\rfloor + 1} & x \textrm{ not a multiple of }n \\
0 & \textrm{otherwise}
\end{cases}
}
$$

Where $\lfloor{x/n}\rfloor$ represents the rounded down result of dividing $x$
by $n$. The probability of rolling a multiple of $n$ is 0, because every time a
multiple of $n$ would show up, it triggers a dice explosion. The below graph shows 
the outcome probabilities when rolling an exploding d6.

<VegaWrapper spec={d6_pmf_vega} />

Within a given number of explosions, each outcome is equally likely. As the
number of explosions increases, the probability decays rapidly due to the rarity
of rolling many 6s in a row. This particular graph cuts off at 18, but in
reality it continues to infinity with ever decreasing probabilities.

The probability of at least $k$ explosions on an $n$ sided dice is
$P(\textrm{at least k explosions}) = n^{-k}$. Continuing with the d6 example, 
we have:

$$
\begin{aligned}
P(\textrm{at least 1 explosion on d6}) &\approx &17\% \\
P(\textrm{at least 2 explosions on d6}) &\approx &3\% \\
P(\textrm{at least 3 explosions on d6}) &\approx &0.5\% \\
P(\textrm{at least 4 explosions on d6}) &\approx &0.08\% \\
\end{aligned}
$$

While one or two explosions is fairly common, more beyond that are
quite rare, with a less than 1-in-1000 chance that you roll at least 4 explosions
on a d6.

## Explosive expectations

Another way to understand the effect of the exploding dice mechanic is to 
look at how it changes the average or _expected_ outcome of a roll. In
a <Link to="/posts/dice-roll-expectations">previous post</Link>, we showed
that the expectation of a normal $n$ sided dice roll is $(n + 1) / 2$. It is
clear that exploding dice would have a higher average, but by how much?

We'll calculate this by appealing to something called the [law of total
expectation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_of_total_expectation).  It allows
us to write the expectation of an exploding dice roll as follows:

$$
E(X) = E(X | \textrm{explode}) P(\textrm{explode}) + E(X | \textrm{not explode}) P(\textrm{not explode})
$$

By breaking up our expectation into two distinct cases -- exploding and not
exploding -- we simplify our approach. First, the probability statements are are
easily addressed by our previous work:

$$
P(\textrm{explode}) = \frac{1}{n}
$$
$$
P(\textrm{not explode}) = \frac{n-1}{n}
$$

Next, we consider the expected value of a roll with no explosion. Since each 
outcome below the maximum value is equally likely, this the same as the expected
result of an $n-1$ sided roll. Plugging in to $(n + 1) / 2$, we get:

$$
E(X | \textrm{not explode}) = \frac{n}{2}
$$

The last term, which is the expected value of an exploded dice is less clear,
but we can get around it with a little trick. Recall that once a dice explodes,
you can view it as a new exploding dice roll with $n$ added to the final result.
We can express this as:

$$
E(X | \textrm{explode}) =  n + E(X)
$$


While it may seem odd to write the original thing that we were trying to solve
for -- $E(X)$ -- on the right hand side, it's perfectly valid to do and will 
help us later. Now that we have expressions for all four terms in our original
expectation equation, we can plug in to get:

$$
E(X) = \left(n + E(X)\right) \frac{1}{n} + \frac{n}{2}\frac{n - 1}{n}
$$

The above simplifies to: 

$$
E(X) = 1 + \frac{E(X)}{n} + \frac{n - 1}{2}
$$

We take advantage of our trick by subtracting $E(X)/n$ from both sides to
gather all the $E(X)$ terms on the right and solve to get:

$$
\boxed{
E(X) = \frac{n}{n-1} \frac{n + 1}{2}
}
$$

Careful inspection of our final result shows that the expectation of a normal 
dice roll appears on in our result, $(n + 1)/2$. **A succinct way to summarize 
the effects of the exploding dice mechanic is that it increases the expected 
result by a factor of $n / (n - 1)$.** 

Revisiting our $n=6$ case, we plug in to see that $E(X) = 4.2$. A notable
increase over the normal average of 3.5. The below graph summarizes the 
differences over the standard dice from d4 up to d20.

<VegaWrapper spec={exploding_expectations_vega} />

While the effect is of a similar magnitude across different types, it is 
most significant for low-faced dice. The factor of increase, $n / (n - 1)$, quickly
approaches 1 as $n$ increases, but with few sides it is relatively large. For a
d4, the increase from an average roll of 2.5 to one of 3.33, represents a 33%
increase. On the other hand, the d20's 10.5 to 11.05 increase is a meager 5%. The graph
below shows percent increase of the exploding mechanic across the standard dice types:

<VegaWrapper spec={percent_increase_vega} />

Despite explosions having a consistent increase the expected outcome, as a 
percent difference, the effect is attenuated for high-sided dice.
Such a difference suggests some reasoning behind the prevalence of exploding
dice in d6 systems, but less so in those with a greater d20 focus.

Regardless of those differences, exploding dice is a fun mechanic that leads to
some interesting math and meaningfully alters outcomes in systems that employ
it.
