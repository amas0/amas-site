Progression in Dungeons and Dragons revolves around gaining levels, in which
your character becomes more powerful. One component of leveling up is
increasing your maximum hit points each level. The rules as written provide
two alternate ways of determining how much of an increase you get:

> Each time you gain a level, you gain 1 additional Hit Die. Roll 
> that Hit Die, add your Constitution modifier to the roll, and add 
> the total to your hit point maximum. Alternatively, you can use the 
> fixed value shown in your class entry, which is the average result
> of the die roll (rounded up). -- *Player's Handbook p. 15*

An interesting bit here is that the fixed health rule uses the _rounded 
up_ average of the roll. This means that **the fixed value will
be better than rolling, on average.** In this post, we'll dig in a bit 
deeper, talk about the math behind each rule, and compare the practical 
differences.

## Defining the strategies

Our approach to comparing these rules is to define them mathematically as 
random variables. As for notation, we will use $X_{\mathrm{roll}}^k$ and
$X_{\mathrm{fixed}}^k$, to represent the amount of health gained after
leveling up $k$ times for the rolling and fixed health rules, respectively.

The fixed health rule increases your character's health pool by the same
amount each level, which we write as:

$$
X_{\mathrm{fixed}}^k = k\left(\frac{d+2}{2} + C_{mod}\right)
$$

Where $d$ is the value of your class's hit dice and $C_{mod}$ is your
constitution modifier. As an example, suppose you are playing a Bard
with a +1 Constitution modifier, then $X_{\mathrm{fixed}}^k = 6k$.
Each level you gain 6 health (until your constitution modifier changes).

The rolling strategy is a bit more complex. If we let $Y_d^k$ represent 
the sum of $k$ $d$-sided dice rolls, we can write the health gained 
from the dice rolling rule as:

$$
X_{\mathrm{roll}}^k = k C_{mod} + Y_d^k 
$$

Since we are primarily interested in comparing these two rules, we 
can look directly at the _difference_ between them, $\Delta X^k_d =
X_\mathrm{fixed}^k - X_\mathrm{roll}^k$, which represents how much better the
fixed strategy is compared to rolling after $k$ level ups of a class with 
hit dice $d$. We can rewrite it using the definitions above:

$$
\Delta X^k_d = k \frac{d+2}{2} - Y_d^k
$$

Our dependence on the constitution modifier drops completely and we have a
random variable defined in terms of the sum of dice rolls.

## Expected differences

A simple step from here is to take a look at the expectation of this 
difference between the rules. Applying the tools that we looked at in a
post on <Link to="/posts/dice-roll-expectations">expectations of dice rolls</Link> we can tackle this:

$$
\begin{aligned}
E\left(\Delta X^k_d\right) &= k \frac{d + 2}{2} - E Y_d^k \\
&= k\frac{d+2}{2} - k \frac{d+1}{2} \\
E\left(\Delta X^k_d\right) &= \frac{k}{2}
\end{aligned}
$$

Simply put: **the fixed health increase will give you 1 more hit point every
2 levels, on average**. It's no surprise that this value comes up, because it
is exactly the amount that is gained by rounding up the average roll each level.

## The probability distribution of how much better fixed health is

The expectation is not the whole picture, of course. The whole point 
of rolling is the element of randomness in the process. We can do a 
bit of algebra to write out the probability distribution of $\Delta X^k_d$ 
in terms of the sum of dice rolls:

$$
P(\Delta X^k_d = x) = P\left(Y_d^k = k\frac{d+2}{2} - x\right)
$$

Using the results from our <Link to="/posts/sums-dice-rolls">recent post</Link>
on dice roll sums, we can write out the exact form:

$$
P(\Delta X^k_d = x) = \frac{1}{d^k}\sum_{l=0}^{\left\lfloor\frac{k}{2} - \frac{x}{d}\right\rfloor} (-1)^l {k \choose l} {k\frac{d+2}{2} - x - dl - 1 \choose k - 1}
$$

It's a bit messy, but we can calculate some interesting quantities,
such as the probability that the fixed health increase on level up is strictly 
better than rolling -- $P(\Delta X^k_d > 0)$ -- by adding up terms when $x >
0$. The below graph shows how this quantity changes as you level
up:

<VegaWrapper spec={probability_fixed_better_vega} />

There are a few interesting features here. The 
first is how **the benefits of taking the fixed health increase are greater
with a low hit dice** -- by 5th level a Wizard or Sorcerer has a 2-in-3 
chance of having more health by taking fixed increases. On the other hand, 
a class with a d10 hit dice doesn't reach that same likelihood 
until around 10th or 11th level. 

Conceptually, this arises because the $\frac{1}{2}$ average benefit is fairly 
large relative to the range of possible outcomes on a d6, but on a d12? Not
so much.

The second interesting point on this graph (to me) is that **there is 
no difference between fixed health and rolling if you only do it once!** So 
if you're one of those people who wants to mathematically min-max your 
character to the greatest degree possible, you can still have a little fun 
by rolling for health _just one time_. 

## Just how big is the difference?

While the above is more focused on whether there is any difference at all,
probably what would be more interesting is looking at the range of possible
outcomes and seeing how the *actual hit point increases vary between 
the different rules*. 

In the below figure, we compare the fixed health rule (horizontal line)
with the 50% central interval of outcomes from the rolling strategy, you 
can think of the interval as the range of possible outcomes that are pretty
close to average.

<VegaWrapper spec={interval_fixed_vs_rolling_vega} />

We are only showing the results for d6 and d12 hit dice up to 11th level to
avoid cluttering the graph, but the behavior we see is consistent for the 
other hit dice as well. The key feature is that the health pool of the fixed
increases inches its way to the upper end of the central interval. By 11th
level, fixed health increases are either just outside the 50% interval as
is the case for d6 hit dice, or at the upper end of the range as we see for
d12.

In all cases, the fixed health outcome is relatively close to the central
intervals, which means that the difference between the two rules isn't
that big. If I had to sum it up, I'd say that **although the odds favor the
fixed health strategy, it wouldn't be surprising if someone happened
to roll higher health in the long term.**

## Which strategy to pick?

The way you choose to advance your character's health is one of the more
minor decisions you have to make in DnD. But hey. That doesn't stop us from 
talking about the pros and cons of each rule:

#### Why choose fixed increases?

* Mathematically, it wins on average
* Especially when playing a low hit dice class like Wizard, hit points come 
at a premium and taking the fixed value is a prudent choice
* At low levels, rolling a 1 or 2 for health can have fatal 
consequences -- avoiding that by taking fixed increases could be the difference
between life and death for your character

#### Why choose rolling for health?

* Rolling is fun!
* The benefits of fixed increases for are smaller for high hit dice classes, 
so you risk less by choosing to roll 
* Fixed health prevents you from getting low values, but it also prevents 
you from getting high values as well -- if you want to press your luck, there's 
no better way to get a big health pool than some lucky rolls

Outside of any number-based arguments, just **pick the strategy that is most
likely to give you a character/style of play that you have the most fun with.**
It is a game, after all.
