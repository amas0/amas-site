Continuing our <Link to="/posts/advantage-disadvantage-tips">previous</Link> <Link to="/posts/advantage-disadvantage-distribution">discussions</Link> on 
the Advantage and Disadvantage mechanic in DnD 5e, we are going to examine
a straightforward question -- **how much is advantage worth?**

On the surface, the question is open ended -- it requires defining 
"worth" in some way. A decent interpretation is "some measure of how 
much advantage increases your chance of success". In our <Link to="/posts/advantage-disadvantage-tips">post on probability rules of thumb</Link> for 
the mechanic, we give general statements on the outcome of the dice rolls,
such as "you are more likely to get a 20 than rolling below a 7". It gives
a feel for relative likelihoods, but still leaves us stuck thinking in terms 
of probabilities, which suffer from being challenging to interpret. 

Another popular way to summarize advantage is to ground it in familiar DnD 
terms as a "bonus". Bonuses are numbers added (or subtracted) from 
dice rolls depending on how good (or bad) a character is at a certain action,
e.g. a barbarian will usually have a higher bonus for swinging a greataxe than
a wizard and therefore a higher chance to hit. 

Framing advantage as a bonus has led to the claim that **"advantage gives you
about a +5 bonus to your roll"** -- is this true? People are usually quick 
to point out that such a rule is an oversimplification, but how wrong is it?
Let's dig into the math and explore!

## The math

As per usual, we will work out the solution for $n$ sided dice and substitute
in d20s at the end. We have two random variables that we want to look at:

$$
X_{adv} \sim \mathrm{Adv}(n) \qquad X \sim \mathrm{Dice}(n)
$$

The left being rolling with advantage, which we explore <Link to="/posts/advantage-disadvantage-distribution">here</Link>, and 
the right being a simple $n$ sided dice roll, explored <Link to="/posts/dice-roll-probability">here</Link>.
We want to show when these two have the same probability of success by adding
a bonus, $b$, to the simple dice roll. "Success" in DnD meaning "rolling at or
above a target value". We can represent this as:

$$
P(X_{adv} \geq x) = P(X + b \geq x)
$$

In the above, we are most interested in the bonus, $b$. That tells us how 
much advantage is "worth" by drawing a direct equivalence with adding a 
modifier to a normal roll.
